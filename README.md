> A C++ OpenGL ES 2.0 engine for Android

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

The main program is in:
* [app/src/main/cpp/src/](app/src/main/cpp/src/)

The assets are stored in:
* [app/src/main/assets/](app/src/main/assets/)

It makes use of the following libraries:
* [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org) in [app/src/main/cpp/bullet/](app/src/main/cpp/bullet/)
* [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net) in [app/src/main/cpp/glm/](app/src/main/cpp/glm/)
* [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) in [app/src/main/cpp/SDL/](app/src/main/cpp/SDL/)
* [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) in [app/src/main/cpp/SDL_image/](app/src/main/cpp/SDL_image/)
* [SDL_mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) in [app/src/main/cpp/SDL_mixer/](app/src/main/cpp/SDL_mixer/)

The rest is just the Android Studio boilerplate.
